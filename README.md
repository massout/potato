# build & run
This project requires the `make`, `qemu-system-aarch64` and `aarch64-none-elf-gcc` packages to generate and execute code. The `make` build system is implemented in this project.

`make all (or just make)` -> to build project</br>
`make clear` -> to delete the `kernel8.img` image files of the project</br>
`make run` -> to run kernel8.img kernel file in qemu
